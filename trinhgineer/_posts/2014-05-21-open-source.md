title: Why I love Open-Source
foo: bar

I know a lot of people have written at great length why they love this
stack, or that stack because of speed, performance, tooling, marketplace
position, etc. etc. This is not that kind of post. It's really a love
letter to the whole idea of open-source software.

# Open

> Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow

It's no surprise to those of you who know me personally that the open
part of open source has it's own intrinsic value to me. It so perfectly
lines up with my idea of fairness, equality, efficiency, and efficacy.
It is transparent, informative, educational, and adds great value to our
culture.

Those of us who have worked on open source projects know just how
valuable the whole community to making software. [Linus's
Law](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus's_Law) is a perfect expression
of this idea. Enlisting the help of your fellow community members, who
really have the most to gain from what you are developing, is more than
just a cost-saving measure. It is responsible and liberating!

# Source

The other oft-cited benefit of open source is being able to interact
with the source itself. The obvious upshot is being able to make
changes to the source, but something that is just as useful is being
able to inspect the source in order to use the bit of software more
effectively.

I have, on countless occasions, dug into the source for a tool I was
using in order to get a deeper understanding of what, exactly, the tool
expected from me.

# Conclusion

Open source is more than free software. It is an idea that has
far-reaching implications to our society as a whole, while also offering
many pragmatic advantages over the closed source model. I encourage
everyone to think about more ways to leverage the power of open source.
