title: "It's like Harry Potter Newspapers! Augmented Reality"
---

I've just stumbled upon a really interesting new set of technologies
that has really blown me away. The umbrella term is called Augmented
Reality and it is simply the idea of attaching virtual content to things in the
physical world. Most of the people developing in this world are using
smartphones and tablets, but you can create really powerful AR
applications using digital cameras, and fast computers.
